# Security Audit Report - LiveKit Demo Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit was performed on the LiveKit demo Kubernetes infrastructure designed to support 1000+ concurrent participants. While the codebase demonstrates good practices in some areas (particularly secrets management), several critical security issues were identified that should be addressed before production deployment.

### Overall Security Score: **6/10**

**Strengths:**
- Excellent secrets management using External Secrets Operator
- Proper TLS/HTTPS for all external endpoints
- Good use of GitOps practices
- Automated certificate management with cert-manager

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- No network policies (allow-all traffic between pods)
- Services running as root with excessive privileges
- Missing authentication on ingresses
- Unencrypted internal service communication

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Secrets Management (Score: 9/10) ✅

**Positive Findings:**
- All credentials managed through External Secrets Operator (ESO)
- No hardcoded passwords or API keys in YAML files
- Strong password generation policies (16-40 character passwords)
- Proper use of Kubernetes secrets with `secretKeyRef`

**Minor Issues:**
- External Secrets use `refreshInterval: "0"` (no rotation)
- Some usernames are hardcoded (e.g., Harbor admin, MySQL user)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement periodic secret rotation
- Make all usernames configurable via ConfigMaps

### 2. RBAC and Permissions (Score: 7/10) ⚠️

**Positive Findings:**
- Minimal RBAC permissions (only `get` verb for secrets)
- Service accounts created only when necessary
- No wildcard permissions found

**Issues:**
- Unnecessary use of ClusterRoles for namespace-scoped operations
- Privileged container in node-tuning job with host namespace access

**Recommendations:**
- Convert ClusterRoles to namespace-scoped Roles
- Document security implications of privileged containers

### 3. Network Security (Score: 3/10) ❌

**Critical Issues:**
- **No NetworkPolicies** - all pods can communicate freely
- **No authentication on ingresses** - all endpoints publicly accessible
- **Missing security headers** (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **No rate limiting** configured
- **No WAF integration**

**Recommendations:**
- Implement default-deny NetworkPolicies
- Add OAuth2 proxy or basic auth to ingresses
- Configure security headers via ingress annotations
- Implement rate limiting for all public endpoints

### 4. Container Security (Score: 4/10) ❌

**Critical Issues:**
- **LiveKit services run as root** (`runAsUser: 0`)
- **Missing security contexts** on most deployments
- **Using :latest tags** on several images
- **No Pod Security Standards** enforcement
- **Privileged containers** with host namespace access

**Positive Example (MinIO):**
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

**Recommendations:**
- Add security contexts to all deployments
- Remove root user requirements or document necessity
- Pin all images to specific versions/digests
- Implement Pod Security Standards

### 5. TLS/SSL Configuration (Score: 7/10) ⚠️

**Positive Findings:**
- All external endpoints use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Proper cert-manager integration with Let's Encrypt
- No `insecureSkipVerify` found

**Critical Issues:**
- **Redis without TLS or authentication**
- **MySQL connections with TLS disabled**
- **Internal MinIO using HTTP**
- **No TLS version enforcement** (should require TLS 1.2+)

**Recommendations:**
- Enable TLS for all internal services
- Configure minimum TLS version and cipher suites
- Implement mTLS for service-to-service communication

## Priority Remediation Plan

### Critical (Implement Immediately)

1. **Add NetworkPolicies**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: default-deny
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes: ["Ingress", "Egress"]
   ```

2. **Add Ingress Authentication**
   ```yaml
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: basic-auth
   ```

3. **Configure Security Headers**
   ```yaml
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
       more_set_headers "X-Frame-Options: DENY";
       more_set_headers "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff";
       more_set_headers "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000";
   ```

### High Priority

1. **Add Security Contexts to All Deployments**
   ```yaml
   securityContext:
     runAsNonRoot: true
     runAsUser: 1000
     fsGroup: 1000
   containerSecurityContext:
     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
     readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
     capabilities:
       drop: ["ALL"]
   ```

2. **Enable Redis Authentication and TLS**
   ```yaml
   auth:
     enabled: true
     existingSecret: redis-auth
   tls:
     enabled: true
     certificatesSecret: redis-tls
   ```

3. **Replace :latest Tags**
   - Pin all images to specific versions
   - Consider using SHA256 digests for immutability

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   ```yaml
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: "10"
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rpm: "100"
   ```

2. **Enable MySQL TLS**
   - Change `sslmode: "disable"` to `sslmode: "require"`

3. **Configure TLS Policies**
   ```yaml
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-protocols: "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
   ```

## Compliance Status

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| CIS Kubernetes Benchmark | ❌ Partial | Missing network policies, pod security |
| PCI DSS | ❌ No | Unencrypted internal traffic, no access controls |
| HIPAA | ❌ No | Missing audit logs, encryption at rest |
| SOC 2 | ❌ Partial | Good secrets management, poor access controls |

## Conclusion

While the LiveKit demo shows good architectural patterns and secrets management, it requires significant security hardening before production use. The most critical issues are:

1. **No network segmentation** - implement NetworkPolicies immediately
2. **Missing authentication** - add auth to all public endpoints
3. **Privileged containers** - remove root requirements where possible
4. **Unencrypted internal traffic** - enable TLS for all services

Addressing these issues will significantly improve the security posture and make the system suitable for handling sensitive video conferencing data at scale.
